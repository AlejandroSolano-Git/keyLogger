# keyLogger
The program is a simple key logger that accounts for the user's key inputs. In the collection file log.txt, the information is stored, starting a new line whenever space is pressed. In the output.txt, it deletes the empty lines within the file to shorten the length.

The logger shows in the console when keys like enter and shift are pressed, but does not show them in the data collection files. Finally, the key esc is used as an exit mechanism.
